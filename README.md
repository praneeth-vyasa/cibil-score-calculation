## CIBIL SCORE INSIGHTS
### Objective
Develop an advanced stacking model for predicting CIBIL scores, utilizing dimensionality reduction to improve efficiency and performance. This project focuses on building and optimizing a stacking model with PCA.

### Project Description
This project involves creating a stacking model to predict CIBIL scores. Key components include:

Stacking Model: Combines Random Forest, SVM, and KNN as base estimators with Gradient Boosting as the final estimator.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature set, enhancing model efficiency and performance.

Model Evaluation: Uses 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model performance and prevent overfitting.

Optimization: Improves training time and model processing efficiency through PCA integration.

### Features
Stacking Model: Integrates multiple base models and a final estimator for improved prediction accuracy.
